"Down To Earth"

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart

[Pre-chorus:]
So, we fight, so, we fight through the hurt, through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live, and we live, and we learn, and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

[Chorus:]
So, it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth,
Back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth

Mamma, you were always somewhere
And, daddy, I live out of town,
So, tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So, tell me why am I in tears?
Whoa, so far away. And now I just need you here

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road to get to your heart?
Let's start over again

[Chorus]

Fell so far away
From where we used to be
And now we're standing
And where do we go when there's no road
To get to your heart?
So, let's start over again

[Chorus]

I never thought it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how

Love you

The love, the love is bigger,
The love, the love is bigger,
The love, the love is bigger, big

Gotta believe in me (gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale (yeah)
Put your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't ever, ever let you down (no)
Like a see saw lets you down (oh) you know why
Cause we ain't on the playground no more baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger), I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear,
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

Whoa, remember when my heart was young
It was still bigger than me (still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the school yard
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't push-overs, no more baby,

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger), I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

Whoa, I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger (hey)
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger), I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

Whoa,
(Remember those stroll down street) I remember that
(don't knock ya earrings) like yesterday
(They shine on me) we were little then
(in class daydreamed about you) my baby
Just remember
You wow wow (You wow wow)
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (hey)
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (heart breaker)
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger

"One Less Lonely Girl"

Alright, let's go

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

How many "I told you's" and "start over's" and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises? Be honest, girl
How many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed
Just to take them back?
Tell me that how many "either or's"?
But no more if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

(Oh oh) Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you (you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)

(No no) Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine, in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl [3x]
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back?
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

(Oh oh) Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you (you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)

(No no) Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine in this world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl [3x]
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart (heart)
I can give you a brand new start (start)
I can make you believe (ya)
I just wanna set one girl free to fall (free to fall)
She's free to fall (fall in love)
With me

Her heart's locked and know what I got the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl [3x]
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl (yeah yea) [2x]
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Only you, shawty (haha)

"First Dance"
(feat. Usher)

[Usher:]
(It's your chance, take her hand to the floor)
Fellas, it's the moment you've been waiting for
(Girl if you see something you like then let 'em know)
Ladies, I know you're ready
(Cuz you only got one chance for your first dance)
Yeah, yeah, you never forget your first dance
(So take advantage of the slow jam)
Tell 'em JB

[Justin:]
When I close my eyes
I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long
For this day to come
Now that it's here
Let's make it special (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ is playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Ain't no chaperons (chaperons)
This could be the night of your dreams

[Chorus:]
Only if you give, give your first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth
Under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Now we're all alone (all alone)
Here's the opportunity

[Chorus:]
Only if you give, give your first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Everybody says we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
That's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

If you just give, give your first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
But we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give), give the first dance to me (give the first dance, baby)
I'm gon' cherish every moment (oh, oh, oh)
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

[Usher:]
It's your chance, take her hand
To the floor, to the floor
Girl if you see something you like then let him know
'Cause you only got one chance
Your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah, man

[Justin:]
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

"Love Me"

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

My friends say I'm a fool to think
That you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love

'Cause honestly the truth is that
You know I'm never leaving
'Cause you're my angel sent from above

Baby, you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love you, love you
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you, above you

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you (love me)
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

People try to tell me
But I still refuse to listen
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh, your love

Baby, you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love you, love you
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you, above you

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me.
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me.

My heart is blind but I don't care
'Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared

And every time I hold you near
I never wanna let you go, oh

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me.
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

"Baby"
(feat. Ludacris)

Oh whoa [x3]

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we would never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

[Ludacris:]
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks.
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

I'm gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone...)
I'm gone
